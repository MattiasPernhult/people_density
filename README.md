The raspberries will collect the data which is the MAC addresses and the signal strength. Raspberry 3 will then get this files from raspberry 1 and 2, the raspberry 3 will also use its own file and then do a merge and computation. 
After this it will update the result.txt file which the file watcher is listening on. The file watcher will register that a changes has occurred and then it will process the result.txt file and call the server that will insert the data into the database and also notify the clients that are subscribing for events.
